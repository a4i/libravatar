Here is an explanation of what each host does:

www.libravatar.org:
- hosts the main Django applications (TODO: public ones only)
- hosts the static files served directly by Apache

cdn.libravatar.org:
- hosts the avatars over http
- serves the /static/img/ directory (for the nobody icon)

seccdn.libravatar.org:
- hosts the avatars over https
- serves the /static/img/ directory (for the nobody icon)

It should be possible to host these on 3 different servers.


Content-delivery network
-------------------------

In order to distribute the load over multiple mirrors of the
Libravatar avatars, DNS round-robin can be used to make the
cdn.libravatar.org and seccdn.libravatar.org hosts point to
lots of different IP addresses.

Such mirrors will need to have regular (daily?) rsync of
the /avatar/ directory.
